# Enhancement in VIX Trading Strategy: Optimizing Market Timing with RSI, GARCH, and LSTM


### World Quant University Capstone Project


## Project Overview
This repository contains the World Quant University Capstone Project, which focuses on enhancing VIX trading strategy and addressing the limitations of Chicago Board Options Exchangeâ€™s CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) as a lagging market indicator by integrating the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) volatility forecasts, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The performance of the strategies was backtested by trading the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and compared against the buy-and-hold benchmarks. Metrics like Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) were used for comparison and results showed that incorporating LSTM significantly improves performance, while the impact of adding an RSI filter has a relatively little effect.


## Objectives and Hypotheses
The key obejectives of the project is to examine the predictability of VIX level in identifying the overbought and oversold market conditions and evaluate if RSI, GARCH and LSTM can effectively improve the VIX alone strategy by optimizing market timing with the hypotheses that the LSTM model provides the strongest level of enhancement among all tools.
